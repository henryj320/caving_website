        - Looking at the review
            - 99.9% uptime
            - Faster page load speed than Ionos#
            - Actually good customer support! But they take a while.
            - Good interface
    - Ionos
        - Plus - £1 per month (so £12 per year)
            - Then renews at £8 per month after a year

        - Looking at the review
            - Has a dashboard, website builder, free domain, etc
            - Good uptime (around 99.9%)
            - Bad customer support
    - So basically, 000webhost is cheaper, Ionis is more expensive but better. Actually, both have a higher renewal price so it is just which is better.
    - Decision should be to either use Ionos or Hostinger
        - Ionis

            - Unlimited websites
            - Unmetered bandwidth
            - Free domain (for 1 yr and then £10 per year)
            - SSL certificate
            - Daily backups
            - Free email account
        - Hostinger
            - £2.59 per month (£5.99 when you renew)
            - 100 websites
            - Unlimited bandwidth
            - Free domain
            - Unlimited free SSL
            - Weekly backups
            - Free email
            - Support anytime
    - Decided to go with Ionis.
        - Need to tell Alfie:
        - First year
            - It would be £6 per month.
            - £3 + £54 = £57 for the first year.
        - After that
            - It would be ((£6 x 12) + (£10 x 12)) = £72 + £120 = £192 per year.
